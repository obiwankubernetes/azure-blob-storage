This family of techniques is especially useful for safely improving runtime efficiency, in particular for table-rich embedded programming."

Come learn about Visual Studio\u2019s WSL support for C++ development. This demo-heavy session will show you how to configure a CMake project in Visual Studio to target both Windows and WSL. We will cover a few of the ways Visual Studio makes WSL development easier, including streamlined WSL configuration, integrated debugging support, platform-specific IntelliSense to check if your code will compile in a Linux environment before checking in, and cross-platform vcpkg integration. All C++ developers can leverage Visual Studio\u2019s WSL integration (even if you\u2019re not using CMake!) so come join this session to learn more.",

Come learn about Visual Studio\u2019s WSL support for C++ development. This demo-heavy session will show you how to configure a CMake project in Visual Studio to target both Windows and WSL. We will cover a few of the ways Visual Studio makes WSL development easier, including streamlined WSL configuration, integrated debugging support, platform-specific IntelliSense to check if your code will compile in a Linux environment before checking in, and cross-platform vcpkg integration. All C++ developers can leverage Visual Studio\u2019s WSL integration (even if you\u2019re not using CMake!) so come join this session to learn more."

Aimed at folks new to EF Core, Phil shows how to start with an existing SQL Server database, create entities/objects for each table and then how to perform basic CRUD operations on the data. \n\nChange Tracking is one of the most compelling reasons to use an object-relational-mapper (ORM) like EF Core. In this episode we discuss how the change tracker works, see it in action, as well as load data outside of the change tracker.\n\nFind the sample code at https://github.com/skimedic/presentations/tree/master/DOTNETCORE/Channel9. \n\nEpisode list:\n\nPart 1: Working with Existing Databases (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Entity-Framework-Core-Part-1). We scaffold the DbContext and the Entities from the Northwind Database, discuss navigation properties and relationships.\n\nPart 2: Change Tracking (this episode). \n\nPart 3: Basic Queries (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Entity-Framework-Core-Part-3). This episode covers querying data using EF Core. We discuss the basics of Where clauses, retrieving single items or lists of items, as well as when queries actually execute.\n\nPart 4: Querying Related Data and Using Projections (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Entity-Framework-Core-Part-4). Querying related data is simple in EF Core. In this episode we demonstrate creating joins in our LINQ queries with Include and ThenInclude. We also discuss how you use projections to shape the queried data into other objects, anonymous or strongly typed.\n\nPart 5: Putting the CUD into CRUD (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Entity-Framework-Core-Part-5).

In this episode, Chris goes deep into what developers should know when building real-world APIs. This episode expands on the first episode to discuss what best practices developers should think about before, during and after their API project. We look at how and why you should decouple your API from the domain and data logic in your solutions and why we should not use our Entity Framework Core entity models at the API endpoints.\n\nResources\nChinook database (https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase)\nSample code (https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookASPNETCoreAPINTier)\n\nEpisodes:\nPart 1: Creating a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core 2.1 Web API (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Building-Web-APIs-Part-1)\nPart 2: Creating the Best Architecture for ASP.NET Core 2.1 Web API (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Building-Web-APIs-Part-2)\nPart 3: Testing ASP.NET Core 2.1 Web API Solutions (this episode)"

In this session you will learn how to extend your .NET and .NET Core applications with AI features. You will see the multiple ways you can implement AI features on .NET apps, starting from a the easiest implementations using Azure Cognitive Services to more custom and flexible scenarios based on the new Machine Learning .NET (ML.NET). Finally, you will see how you can use AI not just in ASP.NET Core web apps but also Bots using Bot Framework, language understanding, and edge/mobile offline scenarios. The demos of this session will be based on several ML.NET samples plus a new end-to-end app, currently being implemented by forking/extending eShopOnContainers (end-to-end cloud-native/microservices reference app) into a new derived sample app named eShopOnContainersAI which adds AI/ML features based on the latest Microsoft AI technologies available for .NET.",

                    "description": "There's a lot of buzz around AI, ML and deep-learning across the industry, and for good reasons! But that's all for Data Scientists, right? Wrong! In this session you will learn how to extend your .NET and .NET Core applications with AI features. You will see the multiple ways you can implement AI features on .NET apps, starting from a the easiest implementations using Azure Cognitive Services to more custom and flexible scenarios based on the new Machine Learning .NET (ML.NET). Finally, you will see how you can use AI not just in ASP.NET Core web apps but also Bots using Bot Framework, language understanding, and edge/mobile offline scenarios. The demos of this session will be based on several ML.NET samples plus a new end-to-end app, currently being implemented by forking/extending eShopOnContainers (end-to-end cloud-native/microservices reference app) into a new derived sample app named eShopOnContainersAI which adds AI/ML features based on the latest Microsoft AI technologies available for .NET."

Guests and business travelers can book rooms and smart conference rooms as well as customize room temperature and lighting settings.\n\u2022 Travelers need quick access to their rooms. We included NFC access from the SmartHotel360 traveler application and we also created a digital door application to check-in and open your room.\n\u2022 Mixed reality apps provide hotel management the ability to visualize data and review proposed changes to the hotel lobby by using both HoloLens and the latest in immersive headsets. \n\nEpisodes in this series:\n\u2022 Overview: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Overview\n\u2022 Web site and Azure Function: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Web-Site\n\u2022 Mobile and desktop apps: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Mobile-Apps\n\u2022 Containers and backend microservices: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Backend-Services\n\u2022 Mixed reality: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Mixed-Reality\n\u2022 Modernizing Existing Apps (this episode) \n\nResources:\n\u2022 SmartHotel360 Series: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/12/13/connect-2017-smarthotel360-demo-apps-and-architecture/\n\u2022 Mikkel Hegnhoj: http://twitter.com/mikkelhegn\n\u2022 Azure Service Fabric team: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/\n\u2022 SmartHotel360 in GitHub: http://aka.ms/smarthotel360\n\u2022 Visual Studio blog: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/12/13/connect-2017-smarthotel360-demo-apps-and-architecture/\n\u2022 Connect() keynote demos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRfBAR43pZrcTTJ3LTa9hdsV\n\u2022 Connect() keynotes, sessions, on demand videos: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017",

Guests and business travelers can book rooms and smart conference rooms as well as customize room temperature and lighting settings.\n- Travelers need quick access to their rooms. We included NFC access from the SmartHotel360 traveler application and we also created a digital door application to check-in and open your room.\n- Mixed reality apps provide hotel management the ability to visualize data and review proposed changes to the hotel lobby by using both HoloLens and the latest in immersive headsets. \n\nEpisodes in this series:\n- Overview: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Overview\n- Web site and Azure Function: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SmartHotel360-Demo-App-Web-Site\n- Mobile and desktop apps: https://youtu.be/_hUeIMB-j0Q \n- Containers and back end microservices (this episode)\n- Mixed reality\n\nResources:\n- SmartHotel360 in GitHub: http://aka.ms/smarthotel360\n- Visual Studio blog: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/12/13/connect-2017-smarthotel360-demo-apps-and-architecture/\n- Connect() keynote demos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRfBAR43pZrcTTJ3LTa9hdsV\n- Connect() keynotes, sessions, on demand videos: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017"

In this episode, Erika Ehrli takes us on a tour of the app and provides insights into its architecture and some of the design decisions that went into its creation. \n\nSmartHotel360 is a fictitious smart hospitality company showcasing the future of connected travel:  \n\n- The heart of this application is Azure and the code is built using a microservice oriented architecture orchestrated with multiple Docker containers. \n- The public website is where hotel guests can book a room, smart conference rooms, and even include their accompanying family travelers and their pets!\n- SmartHotel360 offers a fully-native cross-device mobile app for guests and business travelers built with Xamarin. Guests and business travelers can book rooms and smart conference rooms as well as customize room temperature and lighting settings.\n- Travelers need quick access to their rooms. We included NFC access from the SmartHotel360 traveler application and we also created a digital door application to check-in and open your room.\n- Mixed reality apps provide hotel management the ability to visualize data and review proposed changes to the hotel lobby by using both HoloLens and the latest in immersive headsets. \n\nEpisodes in this series:\n\nOverview (this episode)\nWeb site and Azure Function\nMobile and desktop apps\nContainers and back end microservices\nMixed reality\n\nResources:\n\n- SmartHotel360 in GitHub: http://aka.ms/smarthotel360\n- Visual Studio blog: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/12/13/connect-2017-smarthotel360-demo-apps-and-architecture/\n- Connect() keynote demos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRfBAR43pZrcTTJ3LTa9hdsV\n- Connect() keynotes, sessions, on demand videos: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017"

From with SQL Server Management Studio, you can add the changes to version control, and then use them in a CI/CD pipeline using Visual Studio Team Services. \n\nSteve shows now only how to capture database changes, but also use the TSQLT database unit testing framework with your database code, and incorporate testing into an automated database deployment process. Our database code is treated just like application code by making changes to a branch, creating a pull request, and then allowing VSTS to build, test, and release database code.\n\nResources:\n\n- DLM Automation: https://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/dlm-automation/\n- SQL Source Control: https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/\n- TSQLT: https://tsqlt.org/",

                    "description": "In this second of two episodes, Robert is joined by Steve Jones to discuss how you can use Redgate's DLM Automation tools to extend DevOps practices to SQL Server and Azure SQL databases.\n\nIn this episode, Steve demonstrates the comparison-based approach used by SQL Source Control, which generates SQL scripts by comparing the state of version control with your development database. From with SQL Server Management Studio, you can add the changes to version control, and then use them in a CI/CD pipeline using Visual Studio Team Services. \n\nSteve shows now only how to capture database changes, but also use the TSQLT database unit testing framework with your database code, and incorporate testing into an automated database deployment process. Our database code is treated just like application code by making changes to a branch, creating a pull request, and then allowing VSTS to build, test, and release database code.\n\nResources:\n\n- DLM Automation: https://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/dlm-automation/\n- SQL Source Control: https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/\n- TSQLT: https://tsqlt.org/"

He'll show us exactly how easy it was to port, demo the code actually running against some sample solutions and discuss his views on .NET Core 2.0, and why we believe it's finally ready to go big with open source project developers, enterprises and beyond.\n\nResources:\n\n- .NET Core 2.0: https://www.microsoft.com/net\n- Blog post: https://jlik.me/78\n- GitHub: https://github.com/JeremyLikness/sterling-net-core\n- Follow Jeremy Likness on Twitter @JeremyLikness: https://www.twitter.com/JeremyLikness\n- Follow Dmitry Lyalin on Twitter @lyalindotcom: https://www.twitter.com/lyalindotcom",

Jeremy will cover what recently inspired him to convert this 2010 built data library and port it to run on .NET Core 2.0 thanks to advances in .NET Standard 2.0 that made it (finally) possible. He'll show us exactly how easy it was to port, demo the code actually running against some sample solutions and discuss his views on .NET Core 2.0, and why we believe it's finally ready to go big with open source project developers, enterprises and beyond.\n\nResources:\n\n- .NET Core 2.0: https://www.microsoft.com/net\n- Blog post: https://jlik.me/78\n- GitHub: https://github.com/JeremyLikness/sterling-net-core\n- Follow Jeremy Likness on Twitter @JeremyLikness: https://www.twitter.com/JeremyLikness\n- Follow Dmitry Lyalin on Twitter @lyalindotcom: https://www.twitter.com/lyalindotcom"

A design pattern is a best practice you can use in your code to solve a common problem.  In this episode, Phil demonstrates the Simple Factory, Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns. The Simple Factory pattern encapsulates object creation in one place. The Factory Method pattern uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. \n\nResources:\n- Sample code: https://github.com/skimedic/presentations\n- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software book: https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\n- Head First Design Patterns book: https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8",

A design pattern is a best practice you can use in your code to solve a common problem.  In this episode, Phil demonstrates the Simple Factory, Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns. The Simple Factory pattern encapsulates object creation in one place. The Factory Method pattern uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. \n\nResources:\n- Sample code: https://github.com/skimedic/presentations\n- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software book: https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\n- Head First Design Patterns book: https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"

A design pattern is a best practice you can use in your code to solve a common problem.  In this episode, Phil demonstrates the Observer pattern.

A design pattern is a best practice you can use in your code to solve a common problem.  In this episode, Phil demonstrates the Observer pattern. In this pattern, an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. Phil also compares the Observer pattern to the Publish-Subscribe pattern.\n\nResources:\n\n- Sample code: https://github.com/skimedic/presentations\n- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software book: https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\n- Head First Design Patterns book: https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"

Researchers from Intel Labs collaborated with Hawking on a new solution called ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit) that makes it easier for him to communicate, and navigate the computer and the Internet. ACAT uses various Microsoft open development tools, including C#, Windows Forms, WPF, and .NET 4.5, and the project was recently open sourced on GitHub so that developers and those with disabilities could customize it to their needs."
